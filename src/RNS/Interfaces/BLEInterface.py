BLEInterface - Bluetooth Low Energy interface for Reticulum

This interface enables Reticulum mesh networking over BLE on Linux devices
without additional hardware.

Key features:
- Auto-discovery of BLE peers
- Multi-peer mesh support (up to 7 simultaneous connections)
- Packet fragmentation for BLE MTU limits
- Power management modes for battery efficiency
- Linux-only (requires BlueZ 5.x for GATT server)

class DiscoveredPeer:
    """
    Tracks information about a discovered BLE peer for connection prioritization.

    This class stores signal strength (RSSI), connection history, and timing
    information to enable smart peer selection in mesh networks.

    Algorithm Design Decisions:
    ---------------------------
    1. RSSI Tracking: Signal strength is the primary indicator of connection
       quality in BLE networks. We track and update RSSI on every discovery
       to adapt to changing environmental conditions (movement, obstacles).

    2. Connection History: Past behavior is a strong predictor of future
       reliability. We track attempts vs successes to identify consistently
       reachable peers vs flaky ones.

    3. Temporal Data: Both first_seen and last_seen timestamps enable:
       - Recency-based prioritization (prefer active peers)
       - Stale peer cleanup (remove disappeared peers)
       - Connection attempt rate limiting

    4. Separation of Concerns: We track successful_connections separately
       from failed_connections to enable nuanced scoring (e.g., a peer with
       80% success from 100 attempts is more reliable than one with 100%
       from 2 attempts).

    BLE interface for Reticulum networking.

    Implements the Reticulum Interface API for Bluetooth Low Energy

    ARCHITECTURE:
    - Dual-mode: Acts as both central (client) and peripheral (server)
    - Spawns BLEPeerInterface for each connected peer
    - Fragments packets larger than BLE MTU (~185 bytes)
    - Auto-reconnects on connection loss

    THREADING MODEL:
    - Main asyncio loop in separate thread (_run_async_loop)
    - LOCK ORDERING CONVENTION (to prevent deadlocks):
      1. peer_lock - ALWAYS acquire first for peer state access
      2. frag_lock - THEN acquire for fragmentation state
      NEVER acquire locks in reverse order! (HIGH #2: deadlock prevention)
    - Uses asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe for cross-thread calls

    MEMORY USAGE (per-peer overhead):
    - Fragmenter + Reassembler: ~400 bytes per peer
    - Max peers: configurable (default 7)
    - Reassembly buffers: Auto-cleanup after 30s timeout (CRITICAL #2)
    - Discovery cache: ~100 bytes per discovered device (limited to 100)

    ERROR RECOVERY:
    - Connection failure: Exponential backoff + blacklist
    - Transmission timeout: Packet dropped (Reticulum retransmits)
    - Fragmentation failure: Buffer cleanup after timeout
    - Adapter error: Interface marked offline, Transport handles

        Calculate priority score for peer selection.

        Scoring is weighted as follows:
        - Signal strength (RSSI): 60% (0-70 points based on signal quality)
        - Connection history: 30% (0-50 points based on success rate)
        - Recency: 10% (0-25 points based on how recently seen)

        Algorithm Design Decisions:
        ---------------------------
        1. RSSI Dominance (60% weight): In BLE networks, signal strength is
           the most reliable predictor of connection success and data throughput.
           A peer at -40 dBm will consistently outperform one at -90 dBm,
           regardless of history. This weight ensures we prioritize physically
           close or unobstructed peers.

        2. History Matters (30% weight): Past reliability is important but
           shouldn't override current signal conditions. A previously reliable
           peer that has moved away (poor RSSI) should be deprioritized.
           The 30% weight balances this appropriately.

        3. Recency Bonus (10% weight): Recently seen peers are more likely
           to be currently available. This small weight gives a tiebreaker
           advantage to active peers without dominating the score.

        4. New Peer Benefit: Peers with no history get 25/50 points (50%)
           on history scoring. This "benefit of the doubt" allows new peers
           to compete while requiring them to have good RSSI to be selected.

        5. Clamping RSSI: We clamp RSSI to [-100, -30] dBm range based on
           real-world BLE behavior. Below -100 is essentially no signal,
           above -30 is uncommon and offers no practical benefit.

        6. Linear Recency Decay: Recent peers (<5s) get full points, then
           decay linearly to 0 over 30 seconds. This matches typical BLE
           discovery intervals (5-10s) and prevents stale peer selection.

        Algorithm Design Decisions:
        ---------------------------
        1. Greedy Selection: We select the top N highest-scoring peers rather

           This prevents redundant connection attempts and allows the discovery
           process to focus on finding new peers.

        3. Blacklist Respect: Temporarily blacklisted peers are excluded
           entirely. This prevents connection churn from repeatedly attempting
           to connect to consistently failing peers.

        4. Sort by Score: Sorting ensures deterministic selection and allows
           for easy debugging (highest-scored peers are always chosen first).

        5. Slot-Based Limits: We calculate available_slots = max_peers - current
           rather than a fixed number. This adapts to disconnections and ensures

        Algorithm Design Decisions:
        ---------------------------
        1. Exponential Backoff: Blacklist duration increases exponentially
           with consecutive failures. This prevents connection churn while
           still allowing eventual retries if conditions improve.
           Formula: backoff * min(failures - threshold + 1, 8)
           Example: 60s, 120s, 240s, 480s (capped at 8x = 480s)

        2. Threshold-Based Activation: We only blacklist after N failures
           (default 3) to tolerate temporary issues like brief signal loss
           or interference without permanently marking peers as bad.

        3. Capped Multiplier: We cap the backoff multiplier at 8x to prevent
           excessively long blacklist periods (e.g., hours). After 480s, a
           peer is likely to have moved or conditions changed enough to retry.

        4. Failure Counter Persists: We track total failed_connections rather
           than resetting on blacklist. This provides long-term reliability
           data for scoring even after blacklist expires.
